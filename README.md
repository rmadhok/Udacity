# Udacity Coursework

##Overview
I started taking courses on Udacity to learn useful data science skills. I started from scratch and designed a custom course sequence. Thus far, I have completed:
* Intro to Python
* Intro to Data Science

I am planning to take further Udacity courses in data visualization with d3.js and am considering a course in HTML/CSS. I will add the scripts for those courses when I begin
